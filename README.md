# My blog content

Thought of creating a repository to store all of my blog content here, so that I can access it from anywhere and push/edit content on the go.

Although my blog content is here, it's powered using a custom-built [static site generator](https://github.com/megacolorboy/megacolorboy-ssg.git).

Checkout my blog [here](https://megacolorboy.com).
